Experimenting with a shape-shifting game, where you shift into different forms by teleporting into objects in different scenes. This is an early prototype of the game mechanics, using plants as the "secret" item in each scene. Highlight over the plant and use the Cardboard Trigger to jump between scenes.

Each scene shot in 360Â° video with the 360fly camera, and works on the Google Cardboard.

Wear headphones to hear spatial audio/music.
